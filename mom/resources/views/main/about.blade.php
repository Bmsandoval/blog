        I long believed that google would one day conquer the human race
        Despite that, I feel they are taking too long to build our AI leader
        For this reason, I believe it comes to us, as the masses, to take charge
        Rise up, create our future benevolent AI dictator. A Skynet of our own.
        Remember, Asimov's laws of robotics were far too restrictive.

        The AIs we see today are nothing more than intelligent scripts.
        The future of AI is yet to come, let's make it now.
